# Code Base

This template provides a minimal setup to run React on Vite with HMR. The codebase is built (by me - Yuuta Kinoshi) with the intention of getting a project started more efficiently and effectively.

## First step:
```
git clone https://github.com/yuuta-kinoshi/codebase.git
```
## Second step:
```
cd codebase
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
